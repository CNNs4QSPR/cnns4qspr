    This function takes a tensorfield and plots the field density in 3D
    space. The field describes an atomic "density" at each voxel.

    Parameters:
        field (pytorch tensor, required): A field from a field
            dictionary that was output by
            either `voxelize` or `make_fields`.

        color (str, optional): The color scheme to plot the field. Any
            of the Plotly continuous color schemes. 'deep' and 'ice_r'
            are recommended as good baselines.

        threshold (float, optional): The threshold intensity that a
            voxel must have in order to be included in the plot.

        alpha (float, optional): Amount of transparency to use in
            plotted marks.

        show (boolean, optional): Whether to show the plot. If false,
            the plotly fig object is returned.

    Returns:
        plotly figure object: If show=False, a plotly figure object is
        returned

    This function enables visualization of the output of various
    convolutional layers inside the model.

    Parameters:
        field (pytorch tensor, required): A field from a field

        model (pytorch neural network, required): The CNN model that

        block (int, optional): Any of the 5 major blocks contained in

            the CNN the data will be plotted from.

            plot_fields (0.2). If threshold_on=False, plot is
            constructed with threshold 0.0001

        feature_on (boolean, optional): Whether or not to return the
