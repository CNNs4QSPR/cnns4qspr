cnns4qspr: equivariant protein featurization
============================================

Guide
^^^^^
Welcome to the cnns4qspr package documentation! Below, you will find documentation for our four modules:

(1) **loader.py** - a module for generation of CNN input features directly from pdb (protein data bank) files.
(2) **visualizer.py** - a module for easy visualization of structural protein features, both before and within the deep CNN. 
(3) **featureizer.py** - a module for sending loaded features through a deep CNN, optimized to extract rich structural features into a single output vector.
(4) **trainer.py** - a module for creating, training, and saving VAE models for regression/classification tasks using features generated by loader and featurizer.

The purpose of cnns4qspr is to enable anyone to perform high quality machine learning tasks with protein structure data.
