# cnns4qspr
A package for creating rich, equivariant, structural and chemical features from protein structure data. 

## A quick overview of the capabilities of cnns4qspr
Scientists are continually finding applications for machine learning in all branches of science, and the field of structural biology is no exception. The purpose of the cnns4qspr package is to make extraction of high quality features from 3D protein structures as easy as possible for a user. Once a user has their desired features, they may use them for whatever machine learning task they desire. 



### A few demonstrations of the capabilities of cnns4qspr

cnns4qspr "voxelizes" protein structure data, so that data are in a form which is acceptable as input to a 3D convolutional neural network (CNN). Voxelization simply means the atomic coordinates are transformed from descrete points in 3D space, to slightly smeared atomic densities that fill "voxels" (3D pixels) in a new 3D picture of the protein. 

#### Voxelization of protein data
Here, we demonstrate what voxelization of all the backbone atoms in green flourescent protein (GFP) results in. Clearly, the molecular sctructure of GFP is maintained throughout the transformation. This tells us the network will be able to "see" key structural information unique to GFP.

#### Flexibility of feature extraction
It is well known in machine learning that a model will only be as good as the data you feed it. Therefore, in a regression or classification task using protein structures as the input, it is essential to engineer the data in such a way that the most relevant features for the task at hand are highlighted. As an example, consider a task of binary classification: is the protein a membrane protein, or not? In order to answer this question accurately, a model probably needs to see the distribution of various types of amino acids within a protein. cnns4qspr makes extraction of different chemical features as easy as typing them in. 

Below is a demonstration of the differences between cnns4qspr's voxelization of 'backbone', 'polar', and 'nonpolar' atomic channel selections a user can make when voxelizing a protein. The differences in chemical information are clear.
